# ASDFBot
My first C++ project for the [Aitt](https://sites.google.com/view/mcrave/aitt) tinycraft tourament

<strong><i>The bot did not fit the criteria and was not submitted.</i></strong>

The bot was a zerg sunken rushing bot, It will scout pre-defined locations for each map while droneing. 
Once the enemy is scouted the bot will either place a hatchery(If the enemy is not zerg) or simply wait for a spawning pool to start proxying sunkens. 


(I may have over estimated the size just a tiny bit)
